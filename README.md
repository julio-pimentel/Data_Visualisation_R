# Data Visualisation Workshops - Insight RSA
During my internship in Insight Research Services Associated, I developed the visual content and programming code for Data Visualisation Workshops using ggplot2 as data visualisation package in R. Insight RSA is an Australian organisation providing training and consulting in business analytics. The course content was developed by Dr Mark Griffin.
