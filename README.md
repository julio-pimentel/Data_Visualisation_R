# Data Visualisation Workshops - Insight RSA
During my Insight Research Services Associated internship, I developed the visual content and programming code for Data Visualisation Workshops. To accomplish that, I used ggplot2 as a data visualisation package in R. 

Insight RSA is an Australian organisation providing training and consulting in business analytics. The course content was developed by Dr Mark Griffin.

Data Visualisation is a critical skill for any profession because an audience will take 3 to 8 seconds looking at a plot before deciding whether to invest more time and energy trying to understand the plot or skip to the next part. The workshop considered  12 kinds of statistical plots based on the core principles of design.

Identifying the audience is the first step to develop a story and call to action. Ultimately the role of data visualisation is to support the story.

It was a fantastic experience to work in a different language such as R. You can customise your graphs in R using ggplot2, and it is easy to use.
